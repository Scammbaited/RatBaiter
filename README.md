This is a fake website template designed to look like a legitimate remote access tool company. The purpose of this website is to trick scammers into downloading a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) such as AsyncRAT, LimeRAT, or the Mega Rat Pack, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to their computer or network.

To lure scammers into downloading the RAT, the repository includes a text script that instructs you to call the scammers and pose as a new company that wants them to test their new RDP solution. The scammers are promised a small amount of money for their feedback.

The website could hosted on a free web hosting service such as byehost33, which allows scambaiters to create a convincing-looking website without revealing their true identity or location. The site includes a section for downloads of the fake remote access tool for different operating systems.

However, there is a notice on the website indicating that the program has been flagged as a virus by some anti-virus software providers. This is a deliberate deception, designed to encourage scammers to ignore any warnings or alerts they might see when downloading or installing the tool. In reality, the tool is a Remote Access Trojan that gives the scambaiter remote access to the scammer's computer or network.

To use this website, you will need to host it on a web host such as byehost33, and then modify the download links to point to a file hosting service such as Google Drive. They can use a tool like Instant.io to create an instant download link for the file. Scambaiters should use a RAT such as AsyncRAT, LimeRAT, or the Mega Rat Pack, which are freely available on GitHub and can be modified to suit your needs.

You can also hide your IP address using a website called Playit.gg, which provides a free and easy-to-use service. There are several good YouTube video tutorials available that explain how to use Playit.gg to protect your identity while scambaiting.
